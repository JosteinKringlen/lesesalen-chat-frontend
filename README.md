# lesesalen-chat-frontend
This is the frontend/client for [lesesalen-chat-backend](https://github.com/Asteinvik/lesesalen-chat-backend).
It was made during an app workshop over a weekend, so there *will* be bugs in here.

## What the app does
The app is meant to be used by people who want to get to know more of their fellow students. 
You get paired up in a chat room with another person, and get suggested topics/questions that you can talk about.

After an hour, the server will assign new chat rooms, and you'll get the chance to talk to someone else.

## Configuration
If you want to run it yourself, do the following:

1. Clone the repo using
 
   `git clone https://github.com/JosteinKringlen/lesesalen-chat-frontend`
2. Install all dependencies using 

    `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run the code using

    `yarn start` or `npm start`
4. Download Expo on your phone, and scan the qr code in your terminal

**Keep in mind that this runs our backend. We cannot guarantee that the server will keep running forever, so you might want to use your own.**
